      "question": "How is RankCruise different from other AI writing tools?",
      "answer": "Unlike generic AI writers, RankCruise is built specifically for SEO. We combine keyword research, competitor analysis, and search intent optimization into every article. The result? Content that ranks, not just content that exists."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Will Google penalize AI-generated content?",
      "answer": "Google's guidelines focus on quality, not authorship. Our AI creates helpful, accurate, human-like content that follows E-E-A-T principles. Many of our users' articles rank on page one."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Can I edit the articles before publishing?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Every article goes through your review queue before publishing. Edit, approve, or regenerate—you're always in control."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What languages do you support?",
      "answer": "We support native content creation in 20+ languages including English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, and more. This isn't translation—it's native writing."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How long before I see results?",
      "answer": "Most users see ranking improvements within 2-3 months. SEO is a long game, but consistent high-quality content accelerates results significantly."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Can I cancel anytime?",
      "answer": "Yes. No contracts, no commitments. Cancel anytime from your dashboard. We're confident you'll want to stay."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "How does your AI work?",
      "answer": "Our content engine uses 5 specialized AI agents working together. First, a Research agent gathers insights from top-ranking pages. Then, an Analysis agent studies your competitors. A Writing agent crafts the article in your brand voice. A Verification agent fact-checks every claim. Finally, an Optimization agent adds smart internal links. The result: content that's thoroughly researched and ready to rank."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "How do you guarantee content quality?",
      "answer": "Every article passes through our verification pipeline before reaching your site. Our AI fact-checks claims against reliable sources, ensures proper keyword optimization, and automatically adds relevant internal links to strengthen your SEO."
